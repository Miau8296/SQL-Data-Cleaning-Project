# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project

This project is about Nashville Housing data. 
1.) Alter the column name "SaleDate" into Date only without the Time Frame
2.) Fill up the NULL VALUES from Property Address by finding it through the same parcel ID and Unique ID
3.) Delimited or splitting the Owner Address into Street Address, City Address and State Address.
4.) Changing the N and Y values from SoldAsVacant into Yes and No to make the data consistent.
5.) Deleted the unncessary columns from the data.
